# Toggle boxes with React state

### In this project i would like to use React state in App component then create the function and pass this function down to each one of my box instances, anytime one of the box components get clicked it will run this function and tell the app component the state of this app component maintaining needs to change then when the one of boxes state changes React will rerender the App component and therefore rerender the Box component but with diffrent value. Thanks to that i know exaclty which box is flipping its value.

In the app component i included two way of doing that, first one is imperative (commented code) and the second one declarative, 
I have chosen declarative way beacuse it's more consise and React is declarative.
“Declarative”, at least in the programming sense, is usually defined as “telling what to do instead of how to do it”.
